Here's the revised version with improved grammar and structure:

# Bash-Script

This is a basic bash script designed to simplify the tedious post-installation process of Arch Linux.

### Description of the Script

Step 1: Update the system.

Step 2: Install BlackArch Linux on top of Arch Linux, or in other words, enable the AUR (Arch User Repository).

Step 3: Install `gnome-tweaks` (a tool to customize the appearance of the GNOME Desktop Environment).

Step 4a: Install the `yay` Package Manager.

Step 4b: Install additional packages (`binutils` and `base-devel`) required for `yay` to work properly.

Step 5: Install `blackarch-config-icons` to customize your icons (this installs the icon pack; to apply it, use `gnome-tweaks` to change the icons).

Step 6: Install Firefox Web Browser.

Step 7: Remove some extra packages that aren't required (according to my preferences).

Step 8: Install `pfetch` (a system information tool for your terminal).

Step 9: Install `gnome-software-packagekit-plugin` to fix the issue with the GNOME Software app not working.

## How to Run the Script

Step 1: Open your terminal.

Step 2: Clone the repository or download it. To clone it, type:

Step 3: Run the command:

Note: This script is designed to work for the GNOME Desktop Environment only!

Important: During the script execution, type `Y/y` to install a package or proceed to the next step, and type `N/n` to skip the installation or step.

This version improves clarity and readability while maintaining the original meaning.
